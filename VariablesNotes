Java Script : scripting language, high level programming language
-> weakly or loosely typed language (no need of datatype)
-> lightweight and dynamic language used to build UI
-> no need of compiler only interpreter 
-> used to create dynamic websites
-> it deals with form validations
-> JS introduced in 1995 by Brenden eich
-> first js program was developed within 7-8 days with name "Mocha"
-> first name of JS was "live script" later renamed as JS
-> java and js are different from each other
Applications of JS: Mobile apps, smartwatch, gaming, web apps, server side apps




* python and js are dynamically typed.
1. Variables : containers or memory blocks to store the data 
it is used to the data of any kind
and these variables are case sensitive
start with letters, underscore and dollarsign($) and should not start with numbers.
reserved words (keywords )are not allowed

Types : var (1995), let (2015-es6), const (2015-es6)
ex: var a = 10; 
-> stores in browser engine which contains memories: static area, class static method area, stack area, heap area. 10 is stored in heap area.
console.log(a);
-> identifiers are names given to the variables


HOW TO DECLARE VARIABLES?
-->var
-->let
-->const


-->Reassigning is possible
when we use reassigning the new value will get displayed.
when we use reassigning we will get addition value when we use addition of same variable name two time
ex: var a = 5
        a=1
        document.write(a)
        document.write(a+a) // output: 2


USING LET:
same we can reassign using let just like var 
it accepts the reassigning
ex: 
let a3 = 5
        a3= 5
        a3 = a3+a3
        document.write(a3+a3) //output: 20


CONST variable:
ex:
 const a5 = "Jeshu"
        console.log(a5)
const wont accept reassigning
const wont accept redeclaring 

REDECLARING:

redeclaring accepts only by var 
let doesnot accept declaring
var a = 4
        var a = 3
        document.write(a) //output: 3
        let b= 4
        let b = 5
        document.write(b) // output: ntg plain


BLOCKS CODE:

here what the code we write inside the braces
Ex: 
var name = "jeshu"
        {
            var name= "anuuuu"
            console.log(name)
        }
        console.log(name)
the data inside the {} is the blocks code 

USING VAR:
when we use the var variable the blocks code can be accessed inside and outside the blocks and only reassigned value will get prints
ex:
var name = "jeshu"
        {
            var name= "anuuuu"
            console.log(name)
        }
        console.log(name)// output: anuuu
						    anuuu

USING LET:
when we use let variable the blocks code cannot be accessed outside the blocks code
outside console will accept the outside blocks code 
ex:

        let name= "jeshu"
        {
            let name = "anoooo"
            console.log(name) //output: anooo
        }
        console.log(name) //output:jeshu

we can add the items how we did reassigning or redeclaring
FOR VAR:
ex:
 var num = 3
        {
            var num= 5
            console.log(num+num)
        }
        console.log(num+num) // OUTPUT: 10
								10

FOR LET :
EX:
let num = 4
        {
            let num= 7
            console.log(num+num) // output: 14

        }
        console.log(num+num) //output: 8
